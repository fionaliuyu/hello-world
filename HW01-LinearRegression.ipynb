    "The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) states that the excess return of every stock above the risk-free return ($r_{stk} - r_{rf}$) is on average proportional to the whole market excess return ($r_{mkt} - r_{rf}$). The proportionality coefficient is called \"beta\" and it is a measure of the riskiness of the stock.  The constant intercept is called \"alpha\" and by CAPM it must be zero. Therefore, we have the linear regression model  \n",
